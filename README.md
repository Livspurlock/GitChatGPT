# Simplify Your Git Workflow: Introducing Git-ChatGPT, a Command Line Tool Empowered by ChatGPT 

GitChatGPT is designed to utilize the ChatGPT API for interpreting user inputs and translating them into Git command lines. Upon generating the command line, GitChatGPT will execute it to carry out the corresponding Git action.

The primary objective of developing GitChatGPT is to simplify the Git workflow and render it more user-friendly and approachable for beginners or those lacking familiarity with Git command lines.
GitChatGPT facilitates this by enabling users to interact with Git via natural language input, which is more intuitive and easier to comprehend.
